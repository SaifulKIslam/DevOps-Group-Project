## Brief

The brief for the DevOps Group Project is to deploy an application for a 'Spring Pet Clinicâ€™.

<a name="reqs"></a>
### Requirements 

The requirements for the project, which can be found on [QA-Community website](https://qa-community.co.uk/~/_/projects/final--devops) are as follows:

You will need to plan, design and implement a solution for automating the development workflows and deployments of this application. As part of your final deliverable you will need to discuss the project in a presentation and demonstrate these workflows

Using what you have learned consider the following:

-What tools will work for you best? For example: Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible etc. There is no restrictions or requirements on which ones to use; you should decide which you feel are most appropriate and justify their use

-Multiple Environment support: How can a developer test their new features on an environment before merging their changes to the main branch?

-How can changes on the GitHub repository automatically build and deploy to testing and live environments?

-Running costs. What are your monthly estimates? How could they be improved?

### Project Planning
To complete this project we chose to deploy the application via the use of Terraform, Kubernetes, Jenkins and Docker as well as using Amazon Web Services as our cloud provider

### Jira Board

The project planning was done through a Jira board. This consists of a Backlog, sprint, MOSCOW order of prioritisation as well as items to check on completion. Updates were made to this board constantly throughout development.

### Collaboration

This wa sour first group project and so we tried to combine all of our knowledge and skills that we had gained so far in order to work together effectively. We used a [shared Github repository](https://github.com/AAtaya95/DevOps-Group-Project) where all of the other team members to become collaborators.

## Risk Assessment

For the risk assessments we produced an initial risk assessment that was created before we began the project. Upon completion of the project we then went back to the initial assessment to review it and create our final risk assessment.
